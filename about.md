I am a Senior Systems/Devops Engineer developing deployment automation scripts, maintenance and monitoring scripts written mostly in Python for systems primarily in Amazon AWS. I have almost six years experience working with developers to provide stable and scalable services. My responsibilities ranged from deploying new code across multiple clusters of Java/Tomcat and NodeJS applications, to writing Puppet modules or Chef Cookbooks and ensuring proper backups of NoSQL databases such as Cassandra and MongoDB.

My previous fifteen years working as a System Administrator/Engineer consisted of a wide range of technologies including Linux Redhat and Debian based systems; MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle databases; and system integration scripting using scripting using BASH, PHP.
